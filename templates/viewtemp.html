                new functionality, they are left untouched. For example, in Autodesk's AutoCAD, the number of commands has

                Many of today’s programs have not hundreds, but thousands of commands for a user to become aware of and learn [18]. In each
                release, more commands might be added, and without explicit effort on the part of the user to learn about
                new functionality, they are left untouched. For example, in Autodesk's AutoCAD, the number of commands has
                being growing linearly over time. And even with the thousands of commands available in AutoCAD, the largest
                group of users only use between 31 and 40 of them (Figure 1).

                but also learning how to better accomplish existing tasks. In a potential “best case scenario”, the user
                works with an expert next to them, who can recommend commands when appropriate.

                inferring possible operations based on the user's behavior [20]. The domain knowledge base of such systems
                is often pre-designed and self-contained, and as such requires a large effort to build and maintain. With
                Community-Commands, the knowledge base is acquired automatically from a large user community and evolves

                support users by identifying interesting products and services, when the number and diversity of choices

                is collaborative filtering [16, 37]. Essentially a nearestneighbor method is applied to a user's ratings,
                and provides the user with recommendations based on how her likes and dislikes relate to a large user community.
                Examples of such applications include recommending movies [30], news [34], books [23, 36], music [3], research
                papers [29], and school courses [10, 19]. However, research has shown that users may be reluctant to provide
                explicit ratings [5], and so our research considers an implicit rating system for software commands.

                the organization. The system would then make a recommendation if a command is being under-utilized or overutilized
                by an individual in comparison to the group. This algorithm produces recommendations based on the assumption

                Previous research has focused on adapting and optimizing the interface to the current user and context [4, 13, 29, 31], and
                inferring possible operations based on the user's behavior [20]. The domain knowledge base of such systems
                is often pre-designed and self-contained, and as such requires a large effort to build and maintain. With
                Community-Commands, the knowledge base is acquired automatically from a large user community and evolves
                over time.

                Other intelligent user interfaces are designed to observe and learn from users' actions, and accomplish personalized tasks.
                Examples include predicting the user's next command [8], automatically completing forms [15], maintaining
                calendars and emails [9, 17, 38], and assisting users in word processing tasks [26]. Most personal assistance
                programs analyze repetitive user behaviors, and automate the repetitions; in contrast, our system suggests
                useful commands that users usually have never used.

                Previous research [6, 7, 27] has demonstrated the harmful effects that notifications can have on a user's task performance.
                To compensate, there is a large body of work on determining when and how to best interrupt a user [12]. However
                this is a problem which remains open. CommunityCommands uses an ambient display, where the user can get the
                information when they are ready, thus avoiding the problems associated with interrupting the user's work
                flow.

                Recommender systems have become an important approach to help users deal with information overload and provide personalized
                suggestions [16, 34, 37], and have been successfully applied in both industry and academia. Recommender systems
                support users by identifying interesting products and services, when the number and diversity of choices
                outstrips the user's capability of making good decisions. One of the most promising recommending technologies
                is collaborative filtering [16, 37]. Essentially a nearestneighbor method is applied to a user's ratings,
                and provides the user with recommendations based on how her likes and dislikes relate to a large user community.
                Examples of such applications include recommending movies [30], news [34], books [23, 36], music [3], research
                papers [29], and school courses [10, 19]. However, research has shown that users may be reluctant to provide
                explicit ratings [5], and so our research considers an implicit rating system for software commands.

                Little research has been conducted to help users learn and explore a complicated software package using a recommender system.
                Typical approaches to proactively introducing functionality to a user include "Tip of the day", and “Did
                you know” [32], but these are often irrelevant to the user and are presented in a decontextualized way [11].

                The OWL System [24, 25] is one of the few systems we have identified as going beyond these simple solutions. The system,
                which is meant to run within an organization, compares a user’s command usage to the average usages across
                the organization. The system would then make a recommendation if a command is being under-utilized or overutilized
                by an individual in comparison to the group. This algorithm produces recommendations based on the assumption
                that all users in the community should share the same command usage distribution. It remains arguable whether
                this is a safe assumption to make, even within an organization, and the OWL system was never fully implemented
                or evaluated. But across an entire user community, this assumption is unlikely to hold. Users have different
                tasks, goals, and preferences, and so their recommendations should be personalized [31]. The system which
                Linton described is the exact type of system which recommender systems were developed to improve upon. Community-Commands
                uses collaborative filtering to recommend the most relevant commands for each individual user.

                but also numerous domains of usages. While our work is implemented within AutoCAD, the concepts map to any

                Typical recommender systems depend on a rating system for the items which it recommends. For example, a recommender system
                for movies may base its recommendations on the number of stars that user’s have assigned to various titles.
                These ratings can be used to find similar users, identify similar items, and ultimately, make recommendations
                based on what it predicts would be highly rated by a user.

                Unfortunately, in our domain, no such explicit rating system exists. Instead, we implicitly base a user’s “rating” for any
                command on the frequency for which that command is used. Our collaborative filtering algorithm then predicts
                how the user would “rate” the commands which they do not use. In other words, we take a user’s observed commandfrequency
                table as input, and produce an expected command-frequency table as output.

                for movies may base its recommendations on the number of stars that user’s have assigned to various titles.
                These ratings can be used to find similar users, identify similar items, and ultimately, make recommendations

                how the user would “rate” the commands which they do not use. In other words, we take a user’s observed commandfrequency
                table as input, and produce an expected command-frequency table as output.

                that is not useful to the user. An unnecessary recommendation is a command which is useful to the user, but
                the user was already familiar with. Unnecessary recommendations can actually be helpful in improving the
                user's confidence in the system [29], but this is very dependent on the user's expectations. If the expectation
                is that the system will be suggesting "new" commands which may be useful, commands with which the user is
                already familiar may be seen as poor suggestions.
